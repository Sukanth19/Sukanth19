🎓 **Computer Science Undergrad** | 🧠 **Creative Technologist in the Making**

I'm a 2nd-year CSE student who blends **code, creativity, and discipline** into everything I do. Whether it's building full-stack apps, designing game mechanics, or crafting aesthetics in the real world—I’m all in.

## 🔧 What I’m Building

- 🧱 **Creepypasta Web App**  
  A personal project designed to host and showcase horror short stories with an immersive UI. It's nearly complete—just waiting to be published.

- 🎮 **Mini Indie Games**  
  Building games in Unity and Godot—exploring everything from mechanics to storytelling. Small ideas, fast execution, brutal polish.

- 🎥 **Dev Content & Fast-Edits**  
  Launching a YouTube channel focused on **game dev vlogs**, **Fireship-style tech videos**, and **raw build sessions**.

- 💻 **Full-Stack Side Projects**  
  Using Python (Flask), JS (React), and design systems to create simple yet useful tools and productivity apps—built for real-world use, not just tutorials.
